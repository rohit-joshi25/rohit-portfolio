<h1>Why I Chose Web Development</h1>
<p><em>April 2025</em></p>

<p>Back in 2021, I was just a curious student playing around with HTML in a text editor. Little did I know that curiosity would evolve into a career-defining passion. Building a simple webpage and seeing it live in a browser felt like magic to me.</p>

<p>What drew me in was the instant feedback. I could write a few lines of code, hit refresh, and boom — the result was right there. Unlike traditional programming where things were more abstract, web development felt alive and visual.</p>

<h2>💡 What Inspired Me</h2>
<p>I found inspiration from platforms like <a href="https://dev.to" target="_blank">Dev.to</a> and <a href="https://hashnode.com" target="_blank">Hashnode</a>, where developers shared their learnings and projects. YouTube creators like Traversy Media and Kevin Powell made learning not just easier but actually fun.</p>

<h2>🚀 Learning Web Development </h2>


<p>I also followed a few people on Twitter (now X) who posted daily about what they were building. That inspired me to #BuildInPublic too. Watching people share wins, struggles, and progress made me realize that I wasn’t alone on this journey.</p>

<h2>🚀 What I've Learned</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, I’ve learned and built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and experimented with frameworks like React and tools like TailwindCSS. I’ve participated in 15+ hackathons and ideathons and won 6 of them. These events were crash courses in problem-solving, teamwork, and quick thinking.</p>

<p>Beyond coding, I learned how to communicate ideas, pitch projects, and manage time — skills just as important as technical knowledge.</p>

<h2>🔍 Why It Still Excites Me</h2>
<p>The web is always evolving — new APIs, frameworks, performance techniques. It’s impossible to get bored. I love the balance of logic and creativity. Whether it's coding a feature or designing a UI, it pushes me to improve daily.</p>

<p>Also, the joy of shipping something people can interact with — even if it’s just a simple tool — is unmatched.</p>

<h2>👨‍💻 What's Next?</h2>
<p>I’m freelancing, open to collaborations, and contributing to open-source projects. My future goals include diving deeper into backend systems, building SaaS products, and sharing more of what I build with the community.</p>

<p>If you're just getting started — don’t wait for the perfect course or tool. Start building. Build ugly. Build often. The rest follows.</p>
